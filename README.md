# San-Andreas Gang War

I decided to make my server repository public because I don't develop it anymore, sometimes the code there is a mess, unnecessarily complex, somewhere I used useless classes, but still, maybe someone can find a use for it

- GangWar
- Drift
- DM zones
- Freeroam stuff
- Clanwar (gangwar + custom gangs & turfs)
- Some funny things
